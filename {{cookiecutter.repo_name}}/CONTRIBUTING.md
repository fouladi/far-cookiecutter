# git workflow

## Forking vs. committing

If you find yourself implementing a new feature fork an new branch.

## Commits

Commits should be readable enough for any of the contributors to guess
the content by simply reading the comment or find a proper commit when
one knows what he is looking for.

Usual standards remain: write comments, single line short comments and
additional multi line if required (keep in mind that the most important
piece of information should fit in the first line).

Follow the

* [conventional commits guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)

to *make reviews easier* and to make the git logs more valuable.
